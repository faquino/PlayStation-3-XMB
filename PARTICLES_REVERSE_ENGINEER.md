# PlayStation 3 XMB particles: reverse engineering notes

Work in progress, on the `particles-reeng` branch. The goal is a faithful reimplementation
of the XMB sparkles, including how they react to the Sixaxis and to icon navigation.

Everything here comes from firmware 4.93 as installed in RPCS3, analysed with the tools in
[`tools/re/`](tools/re/README.md). **Verified** means checked against the firmware files or
against what RPCS3 recorded while running the XMB; anything else is marked as inferred.

## Where the particle system lives

- `dev_flash/vsh/resource/qgl/lines.qrc` holds the whole "lines" scene (wave and particles):
  SPU tasks, RSX shaders, textures and parameter files. It is a zlib-compressed tree of
  files; `tools/re/qrc.py` documents the format.
- `dev_flash/vsh/module/qglbase.sprx` (PPU, encrypted) loads it and runs the tasks on a
  SPURS instance. The RPCS3 log names it `SceQglLinesCellSpursKernel0`, with handlers
  `SceQglLinesSpursHdlr0/1`.

| File in `lines.qrc` | What it is |
|---|---|
| `spurs/particles/particles/particles.elf` | The simulation: an SPU ELF run as a SPURS task |
| `PARTICLES.mnu` | The system's 52 parameters, as plain text |
| `PARTICLES_UI.mnu` | Interaction parameters: Sixaxis shake, D-pad, icon wind |
| `PARTICLES_SPE.mnu` | 5 values, purpose unknown |
| `override/<theme>/PARTICLES.mnu` | Full parameter sets per theme and moment |
| `lib/particles/particles_quads.vpo/.fpo` | Main particle shaders |
| `lib/particles/particles_second.vpo/.fpo` | Second particle pass, adds glare |
| `lib/particles/particles_quads_debug.*` | Debug variants, never run |
| `particles/proc_iridescent.tga` | 128×128 RGBA colour table read by the fragment shaders |

## `particles.elf`

**Verified.** Stripped SPU ELF, built with GCC 4.1.1 (SDK 420). Same section layout and
startup code as `spline.elf`, entry `0x3070`.

| Section | Address | Size |
|---|---|---|
| `.text` | `0x03060` | `0x7930` (7756 instructions) |
| `.rodata` | `0x0a9f0` | `0x04b0` |
| `.data` | `0x0af20` | `0x0020` |
| `.bss` | `0x0af80` | `0x2520` |

**Verified: this is the code the XMB runs.** RPCS3's SPU cache for `vsh.self` holds 424
compiled programs whose words equal `particles.elf` at the same addresses. They cover 63.3%
of `.text` (4909 words), recorded without a controller configured.

The largest stretches that never ran are the first place to look for input-driven code:
`0x08a74-0x08ff4` (352 words), `0x0762c-0x07ad0` (297), `0x085c8-0x08a38` (284),
`0x0a374-0x0a738` (241), `0x09040-0x093a8` (218). Recording coverage again while using a
controller will show which of them handle the Sixaxis and the D-pad.

## Parameters

**Verified.** `.mnu` files are `#MNU_1.0` followed by `name:float:value` lines.

`PARTICLES.mnu`, grouped by meaning (the grouping is inferred from the names):

  `near darkness` 6.24028, `near fuzziness` 3.79, `far focus` 12.8327,
  `far focus_dist` 3.54129, `far focus_pow` 1.83324, `far darkness` 13.9

`size middle` 0.0218883, `global alpha` -0.555603. Negative values suggest offsets rather
than a parameter set (inferred).

### Theme overrides

Each `override/<theme>/PARTICLES.mnu` is a complete parameter set. Differences from the base:

| Theme | Changes |
|---|---|
| `night` | `far focus_dist` 4.09678 |
| `day` | `size middle` 0.0464771, `far focus` 12.2008, `far focus_dist` 4.02735, `glare` 0.201367 |
| `yoake` (dawn) | `far focus` 12.0064, `far focus_dist` 4.02735, `glare` 0.180536 |
| `higure` (dusk) | `size middle` 0.0464771, `far focus` 12.6869, `far focus_dist` 4.02735, `glare` 0.18748 |
| `black`, `music_1` | `size middle` 0.0464771, `far focus` 12.0064, `glare` 0.201367; `black` also `global alpha` 0 |
| `coldboot1/2` | as `black`, plus `emit vel mul` 3.7496 |
| `gameboot3/4` | 19 changes, including `delta time` 0.08; `gameboot4` also sets `global alpha` 0 |
| `welcome_1/2` | 31 changes, including `emit per frame` 70.5765 |

**Verified: overrides apply at run time.** The glare value the XMB fed `particles_second`
was 0.201367, an override value rather than the base 0.159705.

## Shaders

**Verified** from the Cg binaries' parameter tables (`tools/re/cgbin.py`).

`particles_quads.vpo`, 135 instructions:

- Per-particle inputs: `IN.pos` (ATTR0, float4), `IN.uv0` (ATTR8, float2),
  `IN.rot` (ATTR11, float4, a quaternion). `IN.old_pos` (ATTR10) is declared but unused
  here.
- Uniforms: `_ModelviewProjection` c[256], `_Modelview` c[260], `_LightPack` c[264],
  `_Darkness` c[459], `_LifeBoundsMax` c[460], `_LifeBoundsMin` c[461], `_NearControl` c[462],
  `_FrontFacingQuaternion` c[463], `_FocusCurves` c[464], `_Focus` c[465],
  `_Transparency` c[466], `_ParticleSize` c[467].
- Compiler constants c[457]/c[458] hold the coefficients of the Cg standard library's
  `atan2` (0.999996, 0.332995, 0.195636, 0.121239, 0.0574773, 0.0134805) and π/2, so the
  shader computes an angle.
- Outputs to the fragment shader: `uv0`, `uv2`, `uv3`, `normal`, `pos`, `normal_v`.

`particles_quads.fpo`, 123 instructions: reads those six varyings, samples
`_IridescentTex`, and uses `_LightPack`, `_Color`, `_NearControl`, `_IridescentExp`,
`_Gamma`. `particles_second.fpo` (97 instructions) adds `_Glare`.

### Uniform values at run time

RSX fragment programs embed their uniforms in the microcode, and RPCS3 caches the
microcode as it was uploaded, so its cache holds the values the XMB used.

**Verified:** `particles_quads.fpo` is cache entry `1EB87F9FA7CE69C.fp`, and
`particles_second.fpo` is `ABCA7B86F40031C0.fp`. The vertex programs are
`B9772382535D84E4.vp` and `D19B154BC25B271B.vp`.

| Uniform | Value at run time | Parameters |
|---|---|---|
| `_LightPack` column 1 | (4.16, 2.63, -7.6, 35.2904) | `spot pos x/y/z`, `specular power` |
| `_LightPack` column 2 | (1, 0, 0, 0) | `spot attn x/y/z` |
| `_LightPack` column 3 | (8, 74.74, 0.0390458, 1) | `lambert coeff`, `specular coeff`, `exposure`, then 1 |
| `_LightPack` column 0 | (0, 0, 2, 1) | the eye position (inferred, see below) |
| `_NearControl` | (13.19, 3.79, 0.722, 0) | `size align`, `near fuzziness`, `near align` |
| `_Glare` | (0.201367, 5.44386, 0.99, 4.44) | `glare`, `glare scale`, `glare p1`, `glare p2` |
| `_IridescentExp` | 1 | `iridescent exp` |
| `_Color` | (1, 1, 1) | |
| `_Gamma` | 1 | |

Vertex uniforms live in constant registers and are not in the cache. Their values need an
RSX capture; their meaning comes from the decompiled vertex shader, below.

### Decompiled shaders

**Verified.** With `Log shader programs` enabled, RPCS3 decompiles every cached program
to GLSL when the XMB boots, into `shaderlog/`. They are identified by their inputs:

| Program | Log file (ids can change between runs) | How it was identified |
|---|---|---|
| `particles_quads.vpo` | `VertexProgram34` | Only two programs read attribute 11 (`IN.rot`); this is the shorter |
| `particles_second.vpo` | `VertexProgram38` | The other one |
| `particles_quads.fpo` | `FragmentProgram53` | Reads exactly TEXCOORD 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 |
| `particles_second.fpo` | `FragmentProgram55` | Same without TEXCOORD2, matching its attribute mask |

RPCS3 renumbers the vertex constants a program uses into a compact list,
`_fetch_constant(0..23)`. **Verified** from how each index is used (factor 2 in the
quaternion-to-matrix conversion is `c[456].x`, `w = 1` is `c[458].x`, and each uniform
only touches the components its type has):

| Compact | Register | Uniform |
|---|---|---|
| 0–3 | c[256–259] | `_ModelviewProjection` |
| 4–7 | c[260–263] | `_Modelview` |
| 8–10 | c[264–266] | `_LightPack[0–2]` (row 3 is unused here) |
| 11–14 | c[455–458] | compiler constants |
| 15–23 | c[459–467] | `_Darkness`, `_LifeBoundsMax`, `_LifeBoundsMin`, `_NearControl`, `_FrontFacingQuaternion`, `_FocusCurves`, `_Focus`, `_Transparency`, `_ParticleSize` |

First readings of `particles_quads.vpo`:

- **Orientation:** `IN.rot` is normalised and expanded with the usual quaternion-to-matrix
  factor of 2, so every particle carries its own rotation.
- **Eye position, inferred:** the vertex shader subtracts `_LightPack` column 0 (0, 0, 2)
  from the particle position and normalises the result as a view vector, so that column
  is the eye.
- **Life bounds:** `_LifeBoundsMin/Max` form a box, and a particle's opacity is
  `saturate(5 × distance to the nearest wall)`, so particles fade out near its walls.
- **Size by depth:** `_ParticleSize` is interpolated piecewise between its three
  components, which match `size near`, `size middle` and `size far` (inferred).

## Corrections to `SPLINE_REVERSE_ENGINEER.md`

Found while validating the disassembler against `spline.elf`:

- The 1/6 constant built in `FUN_00005fd8` is `0x3e2aaaaa` (`ilhu r5,0x3e2a` at `0x6018`,
  `iohl r5,0xaaaa` at `0x6030`), not `0x3E2A5556`. `.rodata` also holds the cubic B-spline
  basis `[0, 1/6, 2/3, 1/6]` at `0x08a10`.
- The kernel's per-iteration stride is `a r90,r90,r2` at `0x4bb4`, with `r2` reloaded from
  the stack at `0x481c`, rather than a literal `ai r90,r90,0x400`.

## Still missing

- The simulation itself: emission, aging, integration, and the output vertex layout.
- How `.mnu` values reach the task (the parameter block the PPU sends it).
- The vertex shader's uniform values, which need an RSX capture.
- A full reading of the four decompiled shaders.
- Where Sixaxis, D-pad and icon input are processed: in the task, or in `qglbase.sprx`.
- The function that generates `proc_iridescent`, so it can be rebuilt in code.
